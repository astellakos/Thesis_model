This dataset contains an instance of the Central Western Europe (CWE) transmission system.
It covers 6 countries: Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg and The Netherlands. 
The countries are grouped into 4 zones: AT/DE/LX forming one unique zone. 
The network is based on Hutcheon and Bialek's instance of the transmission system (N. Hutcheon and J. Bialek, “Updated and validated power flow model of the main continental European transmission network,” in 2013 IEEE PowerTech Grenoble, June 2013, pp. 1–5.).  
The network was populated using an industrial database of thermal generators, provided by ENGIE, which includes technical and economic characteristics of 656 generating units. Thermal generators were assigned to network buses according to their approximate geographical location. These units are classified into five groups: 87 nuclear units (85G W), 144 combined heat and power (CHP) units (40 GW), 272 slow.
The time series are clustered into 8 representative days (weekdays (WD) and weekends (WE) for the 4 seasons) and have a period of 15 minutes. 
The data corresponds roughly to year 2013.

This is the dataset that was used for the opre paper "Transmission Capacity Allocation in Zonal Electricity Markets" by Aravena et. al.
